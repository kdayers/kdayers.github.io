excerpt: 'Using a directed graph, a Markov chain can be treated as a dynamical system over a compact space of bi-infinite sequences, with a flow given by the left shift of a sequence. In this paper, we show that the Morse sets of the finest Morse decomposition on this space can be related to communicating classes of the directed graph by considering lifting the communicating classes to the shift space. Finally, we prove that the flow restricted to these Morse sets is chaotic.'

Using a directed graph, a Markov chain can be treated as a dynamical system over a compact space of bi-infinite sequences, with a flow given by the left shift of a sequence. In this paper, we show that the Morse sets of the finest Morse decomposition on this space can be related to communicating classes of the directed graph by considering lifting the communicating classes to the shift space. Finally, we prove that the flow restricted to these Morse sets is chaotic.
