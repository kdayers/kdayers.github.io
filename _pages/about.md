I am an Assistant Professor in the [math department](https://www.csusm.edu/math/index.html) at California State University San Marcos.  My [research](kdayers.github.io/publications) is in the area of dynamical systems and ergodic theory. 

I ascribe to the axioms written by [Federico Ardila](fardila.com):

Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

These statements should not sound revolutionary, but considering the current practices of the mathematical society, they are a pressing call to action.
